# **Google-Data-Analytics-Project**

This is my final project for my Google Data Analytics Certificate. 

* Capstone Study by Christopher Bridges and Urlando James Garcia.

## Scenario for the Capstone Project

I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team for an NBA team. The executives need data processed for key strategies on coaching hires and player development.

## Business Task :
To analyze 3-point shots over the past 10 NBA seasons, specifically to check trends in shooting perecentages and shots per game for players that are shooting below the league average.

## Business Objectives :
* What are the trends and insights identified?
* How could these trends apply to future NBA teams?
* How could these trends influence change in game play and offensive efficiency?

## Dataset :
* The data set is publicly available on [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)
We collected the data from all 30 NBA teams from the 2013-2014 to 2022-2023 seasons, focusing on teams 3-point percentage and shoots per game. We looked closly at the players who shot below the league average and their shots per game each season.

## Conclusion

We wanted to see the trends of the 3-point shot in this era of NBA basketball. This data can be used for General Managers and Coaches to interpret to see what players they can build their teams with, what coaches prefer the 3 point shot and if players can improve their average over time. Another point of emphasis is a correlation between lower or higher shot attemps with a team's win/loss ratio. The 2015-16 Toronto Raptors won a franchise record 56 games with only 7.2 3-point shots coming from below average shooters. In contrast, the 2014-15 Philadephia 76ers had an 18 win season with over 40 3-point attempts per game from poor shooters. The 2015-16 Golden State Warriors posted an NBA regular season record of 73 wins with their lower average shooters only taking 2.6 3-point shots per game. In contrast, the 2021-22 Portland Trailblazers posted a 27 win season with 50.8 3-point shots per game coming from poor shooters.
